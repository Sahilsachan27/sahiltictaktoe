# sahiltictaktoe
"A simple and fun Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Play against a friend, restart anytime, and enjoy a clean, responsive design. Check it out!"

## What's Inside
- A responsive game board (adjusts to different screen sizes).
- A restart button to start a fresh game whenever you want.
- A simple UI that shows who's winning or if the game is a draw.

## Tech Used
- **HTML**: To structure the game and the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and making the game look nice and neat.
- **JavaScript**: To handle all the game logic, like checking for wins and turns.

## How to Play
1. There are two players: **Player X** and **Player O**.
2. Players take turns clicking on any empty square to place their mark.
3. The game ends when one player lines up 3 marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
4. If all squares are filled and there's no winner, it's a draw.
5. Hit the **Restart Game** button to play again anytime.
